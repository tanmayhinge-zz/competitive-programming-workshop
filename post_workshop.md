<h2>Post Workshop Summary</h2>
</center>

Special thanks to all the participants for taking their time and participating in the workshop with such an interest.

This page serves as a summary + notes for you guys.

1.  Basic C++

I would recommend you to use this [Book](Primer.pdf). This book dives into the details of C++ as well as STL. 

2.  Competitive Programming

A really good guide for Competitive Programming is this -> [https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

CodeChef problem statements are the best to begin with. 

[Beginner practice on CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/practice?page=0&limit=20&sort_by=difficulty_rating&sort_order=asc&search=&start_rating=0&end_rating=999&topic=Basic+Programming&tags=)

I would recommend you guys to participate in [CodeChef Starters 34](https://www.codechef.com/START34?itm_medium=hpbanner_2&itm_campaign=START34) which will be held on 13 April 2022. This contest is good for those who have just started their competitive programming journey.

Once you get familiar, you may move to platforms such as CodeForces and AtCoder.

3. DataStructures

I highly recommend you to follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31LgI4Y4DQ) by freecodecamp. This is probably the best explaination you will ever find on the internet.

More resources will be shared by Rahul here later.

4. Algorithms

Get this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) from the libary. This book is referred to as the "holy grail" and believe me, once you start understanding it, it is just the best!

Or follow this [Cheat Sheet](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html) for C++ specific DS and Algos.

That's all from my side!
