## Introduction

I conducted this workshop titled "Getting Started with Competitive Programming" on 09 April 2022 while I was in my final year of computer science engineering at Pillai College of Engineering. It was conducted in association with [CSI-PCE]().

This document serves as a guide for anyone who wishes to get started with competitive programming as well as notes for the workshop participants.

## 1. Introduction to Competitive Programming

Competitive Programming is a sport where you make use of logic, math, problem solving skills and compete with other users to solve problems using code, usually by writing an algorithm to solve the problem.

Any programming language can be used for competitive programming but people generally use C++, Python and Java. C++ is the most used as well as preferred language by competitive programmers.

In these notes, I am using C++. 
In the workshop we used the Codechef online IDE. 

If you need to set up a local environment you can refer this video ---> [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ7Mf7qxbIU)

There are various platforms that conduct competitive programming contests periodically:

- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [Clist.by (Competitive Programming Calendar)](https://clist.by/)
- [StopStalk (Your all in one profile for competitive programming)](https://www.stopstalk.com/)

## 2. Why C++?

"C++ is fast" isnt enough justification anymore to choose C++ as your choice of language because many competitive platforms have adjusted their time limits as per the language being used.

On the other hand, it is wise to use C++ because of its rich "Standard Template Library" also abbrevated as STL.

STL provides you with a strong set of tools that make competitive programming less of a hassle.

[for eg. array.cpp](array.cpp)

Array is just a simple example that shows how powerful C++ STL is....

We will see a few more as we progress ahead.....
