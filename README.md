## Introduction

I conducted this workshop titled "Getting Started with Competitive Programming" along with (person1.link)(person2.link) on 09 April 2022 while I was in my final year of computer science engineering. It was conducted in association with [CSI-PCE]().

This document serves as a guide for anyone who wishes to get started with competitive programming as well as notes for the workshop.
